# Project: Statistical Ananlysis with Linear Regression

## Overview

The goal of this project is for you to practice and implement Linear Regression (with Assumptions) and some statistical analysis using the iterative data analysis process. 
For this project, you are free to choose your own dataset. The best way to find datasets is i) Identify your interests, domain which you always wanted to work on. ii) Search for the dataset in kaggle, or UCI repo. If not found, you can always scrape ;) 

### Note: Make sure you have one dependent variable which is continuous in your dataset. 

**You will be working individually for this project**, but we'll be guiding you along the process and helping you as you go.

## Technical Requirements

The technical requirements for this project are as follows:

* Try to apply everything you have learned so far about data analysis (in creative ways if you can) such as data cleaning, data manipulation, data visualization, and various statistical analysis methods.

* Optional: Would be great if you also Use MySQL & Tableau. 

* Apply the iterative data analysis process -- setting expectations [What you want from the data], collecting information, and reacting to data[What did you find?] / revising expectations.

* Conduct your analysis in Jupyter Notebook using Pandas, Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, and other Python libraries you have learned, as necessary.

## Necessary Deliverables

The following deliverables should be pushed to your Github repo for this project and share your links before the start of Presentations.

* **A Jupyter Notebook (statistical-analysis.ipynb)** containing your Python codes, outputs, and data visualizations. Make sure to include explanations for each of your steps in Markdown cells or Python comments.

* [optional] A `README.md` file containing any additional information.

## Suggested Ways to Get Started

1. Explore data and understand what the fields using pandas functions like info(), describe() etc...

1. Examine the relationships between dependent variable and other features. Use data visualization techniques to help you gain intuitive understanding of the relationships.

1. Make informed guess on which features should be investigated in depth.

1. Data cleaning & manipulation. Apply the following techniques as appropriate:
    * Adjust skewed data distribution.
    * Deal with columns with high proportion of missing values.
    * Deal with records/rows with missing values.
    * Feature reduction. [Reduce or drop columns. But make sure you've valid explaination before droppping]
    * Convert categorical data to numerical.

1. Present your findings in statistical summary and/or data visualizations.

## Project Feedback + Evaluation

* __Technical Requirements__: Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

* __Creativity__: Did you add a personal spin or creative element into your project submission? Did you incorporate domain knowledge or unique perspective into your analysis.

* __Code Quality__: Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class?

* __Total__: Lead instructor will give you a total score on your project between:

    **Score**|**Expectations**
    -----|-----
    0|Does not meet expectations
    1|Meets expectactions, good job!
    2|Exceeds expectations, you wonderful creature, you!

This will be useful as an overall gauge of whether you met the project goals also which can help you identify where to focus your efforts for the next project!
